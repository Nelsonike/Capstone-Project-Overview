# This is Title: Enhancing Blockchain Awareness by Establishing an Online Publication as a Trusted Resource for Business Leaders and Enthusiasts.

Blockchain technology is a rapidly growing field with the potential to revolutionize many industries. However, there is a lack of reliable and up-to-date information about blockchain technology available to business leaders and blockchain enthusiasts. This lack of information can make it difficult for people to understand the potential benefits of blockchain technology and how it can be applied to their businesses or interests; to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and increase profits through blockchain adoption. Likewise, passionate blockchain enthusiasts eager to explore the technology's potential.

Iâ€™m aware that a lot of Blockchain publications already exist but my research on them shows that 90% of those are focusing on the first use case of Blockchain which is cryptocurrency. This leaves a gap in covering other use cases like healthcare, supply chain, government etc, and this is where blockwires.io will come in.

My capstone project will address this problem by creating a blockchain publication that provides reliable and up-to-date information about blockchain technology especially in the areas of enterprise Blockchain. The publication will focus on the following topics:

The potential applications of blockchain technology in business
The technical aspects of blockchain technology
The latest news and developments in the blockchain space
Interviews with experts in the blockchain space

The target audience for blockwires.io includes: 

Business leaders: Business leaders are interested in the potential applications of blockchain technology in their businesses. They want to know how blockchain can help them improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase profits.

Blockchain enthusiasts: Blockchain enthusiasts are passionate about the technology and its potential to change the world. They want to learn more about blockchain, how it works, and how it can be used to solve problems.

To ensure accessibility, the publication will be written in a clear and concise style, making it easily understandable for both business leaders and blockchain enthusiasts. It will also be regularly updated with new content to stay current with the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.

The benefits of my capstone project extend beyond filling the informational gap in the market. 

The publication will play a role in raising awareness about blockchain technology and its potential benefits.
It will provide a platform for business leaders and blockchain enthusiasts to share ideas and learn from each other.
The publication will help to promote the development of blockchain technology and its adoption by businesses and other organizations.

Having worked as a content writer in the tech industry and contributed to reputable publications, I understand the importance of delivering high-quality and engaging content. My experience in writing for TECHx media and other companies has equipped me with the skills necessary to produce informative articles that cater to a diverse audience. This expertise will play a crucial role in ensuring the success of blockwires.io.

Creating a blockchain publication poses several challenges, which I am prepared to address. 

The first challenge is finding reliable and up-to-date information about blockchain technology. To overcome this, I will partner with experts in the blockchain space who can provide accurate and timely insights.

The second challenge involves writing in a clear and concise style that appeals to both business leaders and blockchain enthusiasts. To address this, I will hire/partner with writers who are passionate about blockchain technology and possess the ability to communicate complex concepts in a simplified manner.

The third challenge revolves around promoting the publication to potential readers. To tackle this, I will develop a comprehensive marketing plan that utilizes various channels, including social media, email marketing, and paid advertising. This will ensure maximum visibility and attract the intended audience.


I have outlined a timeline of one month to complete the project. To achieve this, I will need to:  

Build a team of skilled individuals, including writers, editors, web developers, Seo specialists, designers, and marketers.
Find a platform to publish the content.
Promote the publication to potential readers.
I have already begun to build a team of talented individuals who are passionate about blockchain technology. I am confident that we will be able to create a high-quality publication that will be well-received by the target audience.

I have also identified a number of platforms that could be used to publish the content. I will need to evaluate these platforms and select the one that best meets the needs of the project.

For example: 
> Domain name is available at GoDAddy

Website hosting
> Website hosting will be on Ankr, a decentralized web hosting service that allows users to rent out their unused computing power to host websites and applications. Ankr is a good option for our business model because it is affordable, reliable, scalable and Blockchain compatible. Ankr also offers a variety of features that are designed to make it easy for businesses to host their websites and applications on the blockchain.


Finally, I will need to develop a marketing plan to promote the publication to potential readers. I will use a variety of channels, including social media, email marketing, and paid advertising.


In conclusion, I am confident in my ability to successfully execute this capstone project. By creating blockwires.io, I aim to contribute to the blockchain community by providing a valuable resource that fills an existing gap in reliable and up-to-date information. I believe this publication will empower business leaders to harness the potential of blockchain technology and inspire blockchain enthusiasts to explore its various applications.
